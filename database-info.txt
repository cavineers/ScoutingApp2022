Information on the "slave" or secondary database: The database running in the app is called local storage. It runs from a (modern)
browser. It is important to note that this storage does work offline as well as online. The reason for this storage is to save
data quickly while the person is scouting a match and then the data can be transferred later to another file type.

Transitions to master or primary database: Hardwire Connection from tablets to laptop

Master on primary database: This database runs on a primary computer being used by Scouting admin during competitions. This database is
mostly TBD but we can either transition files by plugging in the tablets manually to the master computer or we can use some form of
internet to transmit the files. In addition we will also be able to run a SQL or NoSQL database  which might be able to run smoother
than a self-made database.


Local Storage:
This is a HTML5 integrated storage method. It allows for users to save data in a key / value format using JavaScript. This is integrated
in many browsers so it is effectively offline compatible. This is not compatible with all browsers.
