# ScoutingApp_2.0
4541 Scouting App v2

# Information
This app was designed and created by FIRST FRC Team 4541 Cavineers. This app was intended for use only by 4541 members and only during the FRC 2020 competitions. This uses a secondary and primary database system. It runs locally on a device.

# Format
This app is built on a PWA format (Progressive Web App). It uses a service worker to cache and fetch files that allows the website to run offline. It uses local storage as the secondary database to keep everything offline. It uses a master database running on a computer to keep data secured and to format data nicely for our drive team.

# Getting started
Our app is super user friendly and easy to use! On the main page select your name and select what type of Scouting you would like to do. If you selected pit scouting talk to teams and answer the prompts given on that page and click submit when you are done. If you selected main mission you will be redirected to another page when you will be asked to enter match information. Match numbers should populate and depending on the match number team numbers should populate as well. Select the number of starting power cells and when the match has begun click start scouting. **Only with permissions** there is an override button which can bypass the requirements for moving onto that page it does require a passcode.
