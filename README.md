# ScoutingApp_2.0
4541 Scouting App 2

# Information
This app was designed and created by FIRST FRC Team 4541 Cavineers. This app was intended for use only by 4541 members and only during the FRC 2020 competitions. This uses a secondary and primary database system. It runs locally on a device.

# Format
This app is built on a PWA format (Progressive Web App). It uses a service worker to chache and fetch files that allows the website to run offline. It uses local storage as the secondary database to keep everything offline. It uses a master database running on a computer to keep data secured and to format data nicely for our drive team.
